Fang of Mongo - web based user interface for MongoDB build with django and jquery.

It will allow you to explore content of mongodb with simple but (hopefully) pleasant
user interface.

Curren status:

Fang of mongo is actually rather proof of concept for mongo ui then anything working properly.
Expect all kinds of bugs and limitations. 

For installation instruction, see INSTALL file
To get the idea of code internals, see code_hacking.txt

Project goals:

  allow users to easily explore mongdb content
  and any metainformation it may provide

Roadmap (in order of importance):

  - display collection content in nicely formatted way
  - allow to easily filter and sort data
  - unittests
  - data edition
  - collection and db operations (create, remove)
  - data export to usefull format (html, json, csv, xml)
  - database operation (defining/creating indexes, setting replication,
    sync time and whatever is possible)
  - user management
  - implement some form of mongo console
