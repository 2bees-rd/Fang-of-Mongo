Fang of Mongo (Fom) requirements:

1. python, pythons-setuptools
2. django
3. pymongo (mongo bindings for python)
4. access to mongodb

Ubuntu 10.04 shortcut for getting it all:
    sudo aptitude install python-setuptools, mongodb, python-django
    sudo easy_install pymongo
older releases will require adding mongodb repository,
see http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages 

If you want some sample database content to play with, 
Fom comes with freedb.org music album collection in json format/
See fangofmongo/fangofmongo/tools/sampledata/freedb.json.

I am using it on linux, but there is a chance that  any unix-like os will work as well.

to install Fom, just unpack source somwhere,
and in file fangofmongo/settings.py:
    set FOM_PLUGIN_DIR and MEDIA_ROOT - both contain absolute paths
    set TIMEZONE to your location

go to fangofmongo directory and run:
    ./manage.py runserver

now point your browser to http://localhost:8000/fangofmongo/
If you have installed mongodb locally then just click proceed and enjoy it.
