Fang of Mongo (Fom) requires:

1. python, pythons-setuptools (to install pymongo)
2. django (ubuntu: aptitude install python-django)
3. pymongo (mongo bindings for python, easy_install pymongo
4. access to mongodb, get it from mongodb.org if you dont have it
    (it also may already be in your distro repository).

Fom will much more usefull if you have some existing data in mongodb
I am using it on linux, but there is a chance that  any unix-like os will work as well.

to install Fom, just unpack source somwhere,
and in file fangofmongo/settings.py:
    set FOM_PLUGIN_DIR and MEDIA_ROOT - both contain absolute paths
    you may also set TIMEZONE to your location, but it is not required

go to fangofmongo directory and run:
    ./manage.py runserver

now point your browser to http://localhost:8000/fangofmongo/
If you have installed mongodb locally then just click proceed and enjoy it,
